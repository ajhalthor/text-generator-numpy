# Text Generator (Numpy RNN)

The code builds an RNN to generate sentences using only numpy. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZv_yRgOvMg) video by Ajay Halthor to see a live demo and understand the intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks.

### Dependencies
  - python=3.6.0
  - numpy=1.14.0
  - nltk=3.2.3

### Files 
  - notebook: All the code for generating the RNN
  - npz file: saved model. You can use it to continur training

### Execution
Open this project directory in terminal and type
```
$ jupyter notebook
```
Recommend install jupyter through anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).
